This was my third project made! In this project I used more JS than in my other projects, creating a web application that displays information about characters from the game Valorant. It fetches data from the Valorant API to dynamically generate character cards with 
detailed information.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Core web technologies used to structure, style, and add interactivity to the application.

Valorant API: An external API used to fetch the character data.
